Transparency occupies a strange place in people's mindsets. The desire for someone or something to be more open and trustworthy is a quality you must request. You are not entitled to that degree of accountability by default. Submit your request for all the information we have on you and we will post you a CD in 6 to 12 months. It is all a bit creepy and suggests that if you're not behaving questionably then you must be doing it wrong.

The closed by default attitude is an unhealthy one. When companies keep information closed or make it extremely difficult to obtain data it fosters distrust. Why is this information so hard to obtain? What are you doing with it?
